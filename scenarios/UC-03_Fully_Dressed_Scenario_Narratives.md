# UC-03 Fully Dressed Scenario Narratives

## Main Success Scenario (Happy Path) — Display Registration Error Message

The primary actor initiates UC-03 to accomplish the goal: see error message when registration info invalid. The system guides the actor through the required steps and performs validations and persistence as needed. When all required conditions are satisfied, the system completes the action successfully and informs the actor.
