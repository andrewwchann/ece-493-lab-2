# UC-10 Fully Dressed Scenario Narratives

## Main Success Scenario (Happy Path) — Save Paper Submission Progress

The primary actor initiates UC-10 to accomplish the goal: save submission progress. The system guides the actor through the required steps and performs validations and persistence as needed. When all required conditions are satisfied, the system completes the action successfully and informs the actor.

## Alternative Path 3a

The actor performs the use case, but the condition in extension 3a occurs. The system rejects or pauses the workflow, displays an appropriate error/status message, and allows the actor to correct the issue or try again later.
