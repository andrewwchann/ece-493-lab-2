# UC-09 Fully Dressed Scenario Narratives

## Main Success Scenario (Happy Path) — Validate Submission Fields and Show Status Messages

The primary actor initiates UC-09 to accomplish the goal: validate required fields and show success/error messages for submission. The system guides the actor through the required steps and performs validations and persistence as needed. When all required conditions are satisfied, the system completes the action successfully and informs the actor.

## Alternative Path 2a

The actor performs the use case, but the condition in extension 2a occurs. The system rejects or pauses the workflow, displays an appropriate error/status message, and allows the actor to correct the issue or try again later.
