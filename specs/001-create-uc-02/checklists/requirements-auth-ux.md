# Requirements Quality Checklist: UC-02 Validate Registration Credentials

**Purpose**: Validate clarity, completeness, and consistency of authentication-related credential validation requirements with emphasis on user feedback quality.
**Created**: February 4, 2026
**Feature**: `/home/ajchan/ECE493/lab/lab2/ece-493-lab-2/specs/001-create-uc-02/spec.md`

**Note**: This checklist is generated by the `/speckit.checklist` command based on feature context and requirements.

## Requirement Completeness

- [ ] CHK001 Are all validation steps explicitly required (email format, uniqueness, password strength)? [Completeness, Spec §FR-001..FR-004]
- [ ] CHK002 Are requirements specified for handling multiple invalid fields in one submission? [Completeness, Spec §FR-006]
- [ ] CHK003 Are rules for trimming and normalization defined for email and password inputs? [Completeness, Spec §FR-007..FR-008]
- [ ] CHK004 Are requirements specified for duplicate-email handling and messaging? [Completeness, Spec §FR-002, §FR-005]
- [ ] CHK005 Are user-facing feedback requirements defined for each invalid field type? [Completeness, Spec §FR-005]

## Requirement Clarity

- [ ] CHK006 Is "accepted email format" defined with concrete rules rather than vague wording? [Clarity, Spec §FR-001]
- [ ] CHK007 Are password security standards unambiguous and measurable (length, character classes)? [Clarity, Spec §FR-003, Spec §Assumptions]
- [ ] CHK008 Is the meaning of "field-specific error feedback" explicitly defined (which fields, what level of detail)? [Clarity, Spec §FR-005]
- [ ] CHK009 Is the whitespace-handling rule for email stated in precise, testable terms? [Clarity, Spec §FR-007]
- [ ] CHK010 Is the requirement for password handling "exactly as entered" precise enough to avoid conflicting interpretations? [Clarity, Spec §FR-008]

## Requirement Consistency

- [ ] CHK011 Do user stories and functional requirements align on validation flow and outcomes? [Consistency, Spec §User Stories, §FR-001..FR-008]
- [ ] CHK012 Are edge cases listed consistent with the functional requirements (no missing or conflicting cases)? [Consistency, Spec §Edge Cases, §FR-001..FR-008]
- [ ] CHK013 Are assumptions consistent with functional requirements (e.g., password rules, email case-insensitivity)? [Consistency, Spec §Assumptions, §FR-002..FR-003]
- [ ] CHK014 Are acceptance scenarios consistent with the specified feedback requirements? [Consistency, Spec §User Stories, §FR-005]

## Acceptance Criteria Quality

- [ ] CHK015 Are acceptance scenarios written so they can be objectively verified without implementation details? [Measurability, Spec §User Stories]
- [ ] CHK016 Do success criteria define measurable outcomes for validation speed and correctness? [Measurability, Spec §SC-001..SC-004]
- [ ] CHK017 Are success criteria aligned with the described user journeys and validation outcomes? [Consistency, Spec §User Stories, §SC-001..SC-004]

## Scenario Coverage

- [ ] CHK018 Are primary validation scenarios fully defined (valid email + valid password)? [Coverage, Spec §User Story 1]
- [ ] CHK019 Are alternate scenarios defined for duplicate email and weak password? [Coverage, Spec §User Story 1-2]
- [ ] CHK020 Are combined failure scenarios covered (email and password invalid together)? [Coverage, Spec §User Story 2]
- [ ] CHK021 Are common input-variation scenarios specified (plus tags, whitespace)? [Coverage, Spec §User Story 3]

## Edge Case Coverage

- [ ] CHK022 Are boundary email formats (missing @, missing domain) explicitly addressed? [Edge Cases, Spec §Edge Cases]
- [ ] CHK023 Are rules for handling malformed or borderline valid emails explicit? [Edge Cases, Spec §Edge Cases, §FR-001]
- [ ] CHK024 Is the behavior defined when password violates multiple security rules simultaneously? [Edge Cases, Gap]
- [ ] CHK025 Are requirements specified for trimming whitespace in email but not password? [Edge Cases, Spec §FR-007..FR-008]

## Non-Functional Requirements

- [ ] CHK026 Is validation response-time requirement quantified and testable? [Non-Functional, Spec §SC-004]
- [ ] CHK027 Are security/privacy requirements stated for handling credentials (e.g., avoid exposing password)? [Non-Functional, Gap]
- [ ] CHK028 Are availability or reliability expectations for validation defined or explicitly out of scope? [Non-Functional, Gap]

## Dependencies & Assumptions

- [ ] CHK029 Is the dependency on an existing user-account data store documented and scoped? [Dependency, Spec §FR-002, Spec §Technical Context]
- [ ] CHK030 Are assumptions about email case-insensitive uniqueness clearly documented? [Assumption, Spec §Assumptions]
- [ ] CHK031 Are assumptions about password security standards captured in requirements rather than only in assumptions? [Assumption, Spec §Assumptions, Spec §FR-003]

## Ambiguities & Conflicts

- [ ] CHK032 Is the term "valid email" free of ambiguity given local-part rules and domain rules? [Ambiguity, Spec §FR-001]
- [ ] CHK033 Are error message requirements specific enough to prevent inconsistent UX across screens? [Ambiguity, Spec §FR-005]
- [ ] CHK034 Is it explicit whether validation feedback must identify all invalid fields or only the first? [Ambiguity, Spec §FR-006]
- [ ] CHK035 Are any requirements contradicted by the scope exclusions? [Conflict, Spec §Scope]
