# Requirements Quality Checklist: Create Item

**Purpose**: Validate completeness, clarity, and measurability of the create-item requirements
**Created**: February 3, 2026
**Feature**: `specs/001-create-feature/spec.md`

**Note**: This checklist is generated by the `/speckit.checklist` command based on feature context and requirements.

## Requirement Completeness

- [ ] CHK001 Are all required and optional input fields for item creation explicitly specified? [Completeness, Spec §FR-001]
- [ ] CHK002 Are post-creation visibility requirements (where the item appears) explicitly defined? [Completeness, Spec §FR-004]
- [ ] CHK003 Are creator and creation-time visibility requirements explicitly stated? [Completeness, Spec §FR-006]
- [ ] CHK004 Are cancellation outcomes explicitly required (no save, return to prior view)? [Completeness, Spec §FR-005, Spec §User Scenarios]

## Requirement Clarity

- [ ] CHK005 Is the term "clear validation message" defined with specific criteria or examples? [Clarity, Spec §FR-002]
- [ ] CHK006 Is the handling of whitespace-only titles specified as a requirement (not only an edge case)? [Clarity, Spec §Edge Cases]
- [ ] CHK007 Is the 120-character title limit clearly defined with trimming rules (before/after whitespace)? [Clarity, Spec §FR-007]
- [ ] CHK008 Is "item" defined with required attributes in the requirements, not only in Key Entities? [Clarity, Spec §FR-001, Spec §Key Entities]

## Requirement Consistency

- [ ] CHK009 Are validation requirements consistent across FR-002, FR-003, and Edge Cases? [Consistency, Spec §FR-002, Spec §FR-003, Spec §Edge Cases]
- [ ] CHK010 Do visibility timing requirements align between FR-004 and SC-003? [Consistency, Spec §FR-004, Spec §SC-003]
- [ ] CHK011 Are sign-in assumptions consistent with User Story 1 and FR-001? [Consistency, Spec §User Story 1, Spec §FR-001, Spec §Assumptions]

## Acceptance Criteria Quality

- [ ] CHK012 Are acceptance scenarios defined for every functional requirement (FR-001 through FR-007)? [Completeness, Spec §User Scenarios]
- [ ] CHK013 Is SC-001 measurable with a defined start and end point for "complete item creation"? [Measurability, Spec §SC-001]
- [ ] CHK014 Is SC-002 measurable with a defined observation window and failure definition? [Measurability, Spec §SC-002]
- [ ] CHK015 Is the baseline for SC-004 (support tickets) explicitly defined? [Clarity, Spec §SC-004]

## Scenario Coverage

- [ ] CHK016 Are alternate flows (cancel before submit) fully specified in requirements and acceptance scenarios? [Coverage, Spec §FR-005, Spec §User Scenarios]
- [ ] CHK017 Are exception flows beyond validation (e.g., save failure) specified in requirements? [Gap]
- [ ] CHK018 Are recovery expectations specified when a creation attempt partially succeeds? [Gap]
- [ ] CHK019 Are post-create viewing expectations defined for both list and detail views? [Coverage, Spec §FR-004]

## Edge Case Coverage

- [ ] CHK020 Are boundary conditions for title length (0 after trim, exactly 120, >120) explicitly defined? [Edge Case, Spec §FR-007, Spec §Edge Cases]
- [ ] CHK021 Are duplicate-title rules specified (allowed vs disallowed, per user)? [Gap]
- [ ] CHK022 Are cancellation side effects (discarding partial inputs) specified as requirements, not only edge cases? [Completeness, Spec §FR-005, Spec §Edge Cases]

## Non-Functional Requirements

- [ ] CHK023 Are performance requirements beyond visibility timing (e.g., validation responsiveness) specified? [Gap]
- [ ] CHK024 Are accessibility requirements defined for the create flow? [Gap]
- [ ] CHK025 Are privacy/ownership visibility requirements fully specified beyond "single user"? [Completeness, Spec §Assumptions]

## Dependencies & Assumptions

- [ ] CHK026 Are dependencies (sign-in, item list/detail view) documented as preconditions in requirements or scenarios? [Dependency, Spec §Dependencies]
- [ ] CHK027 Are assumptions about ownership and sharing explicitly scoped as out-of-scope requirements? [Assumption, Spec §Assumptions]
- [ ] CHK028 Is the persistence mechanism intentionally left unspecified in the requirements to remain technology-agnostic? [Consistency, Spec §Requirements]

## Ambiguities & Conflicts

- [ ] CHK029 Is "clear validation message" sufficiently specified to avoid interpretation conflicts? [Ambiguity, Spec §FR-002]
- [ ] CHK030 Is the "prior view" on cancel clearly defined to avoid conflicting interpretations? [Ambiguity, Spec §User Scenarios]
- [ ] CHK031 Are there any conflicts between Edge Cases and Acceptance Scenarios (e.g., whitespace-only titles)? [Conflict, Spec §Edge Cases, Spec §User Scenarios]
